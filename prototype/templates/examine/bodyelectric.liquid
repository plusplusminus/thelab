						<p class="lead">The brain likes to be safe and efficient by controlling the body’s anarchy with organization and boundaries set by modulating neural excitability. To advance the research of non-invasive neural stimulation, we are devoted to exploring the “disruption” of these boundaries and chart the unexplored territory of body and cognitive intelligence.</p>
						<p>To accomplish this we have brought together a network of thinkers with the same quest in an environment that stresses comprehension, communication and collaboration (as well as alliteration). Members of the Spaulding-Labuschagne Neuromodulation Center are encouraged to be active and involved learners weaving together research in the cross-disciplinary studies of engineering, neuroscience, and clinical research.</p>
						<p>This collaboration results in exciting advancements in the science of Body Electric, and also educates a growing community of observers and fellows who obtain a unique knowledge of clinical research and non-invasive neural stimulation techniques.</p>
