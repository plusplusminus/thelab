				<p class="lead">Neuromodulation + Neuroplasticity = Transformation</p>
				<p>The science we explore at the Spaulding-Labuschagne Neuromodulation Center is neuromodulation and it’s impact on the brain and body through non-invasive neural stimulation. This stimulation physically changes the neural connections which is due to the body’s and brain’s neuroplasticity ability.</p>
				<p>Our brains are constantly changing from every new experience or thought. The modulation of the brain and the nervous center through non-invasive electrical stimulation can create beneficial, positive changes to the way we think, move or feel. This is why we state that neuromodulation + neuroplasticity can result in a transformation—both physical and mental.</p>
				<p>All of this is possible with the growing understanding of the science of the Body Electric which we envision as the future of medicine. Body Electric is a body of knowledge to help reveal and understand the logic of the currents and waves of natural energy that moves through our body.</p>
				<p>The Center is focused on pain, neurological and cognitive rehabilitation and physical and mental performance enhancement. Wether ill or well your body has the potential to transform itself. There are three elements to our science—Neurophysiological assessments, Neuromodulation techniques and Neurocognitive assessments.</p>

					<p class="lead">In our lab we use non-invasive experiments designed to better understand how our neurological system communicates with the body. We use two main types of neuromodulation techniques, Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and are investigating and testing other technologies.</p>
					<br><br>
					<p><strong>Electroencephalogram (EEG)</strong></p>
					<p>To measure the outcome for each experiment, we use various techniques. We can use electroencephalography (EEG), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), or even magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure what is going on at the neural level.</p>
					<br><br>
					<p><strong>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS)</strong></p>
					<p>With tDCS we deliver a low voltage electrical current over the scalp using electrodes. The electrode positions change based upon the experimental design. This current passes from the device and through the skull to stimulate the brain. As the current moves through the scalp there is "shunting" of the current, meaning some of the current does not make it into the brain. The current that does pass through the brain is very small, and helps to change brain "plasticity."</p>
					<br><br>
					<p><strong>Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) </strong></p>
					<p>In addition to those techniques, we also use Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) to measure the outcome of each experiment. TMS induces electrical changes in the brain via a magnetic pulse. Similar to tDCS, this procedure is non-invasive.</p>
					<p>This magnetic pulse creates a slight electrical charge in the brain, and creates a physical response. We can measure the physical response via electrodes on the hand.</p>
					<p>This measurement of a physical response is called electromyography (EMG).  Based upon the increase or decrease in the muscle response, we can measure how the brain changes over the course of tDCS stimulation. We can see if the brain activity increases, decreases, or stays the same. This is very important for our research because with EEG or fMRI, we can see physical changes that are related to stimulation, but we cannot see a cause-and-effect relationship. </p>
					<p>With TMS, we can show a cause-and-effect relationship, but we cannot see physical changes in the brain. When we combine technologies, it creates a more accurate picture of how neuromodulation can affect the brain.</p>

					<p class="lead">This mental assessment has advanced from a physical examination with the sophistication of neuroimaging to a neurocognitive process to help clarify mental function in an individual.</p>
					<p>To understand the impact of non-invasive neural stimulation it’s vital to have a comprehensive evaluation of an individual’s cognitive state—memory, attention, problem solving, spatial sense and even emotions.</p>
					<p>With our understanding of the Body Electric synthesis of natural energy between the body and the brain it is important there is a clear picture of one’s relationship between the brain, thought, behavior, mood and body.</p>
